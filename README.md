Car price prediction
Car Price Prediction Project
-Overview
In this project, I worked with the Auto Trader dataset, which is the UK's largest automotive marketplace. The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features and attributes.

# Dataset
The Auto Trader dataset comprises a large-scale collection of car sale adverts, providing valuable information about cars listed on the platform. The dataset includes features such as car make, model, year, mileage, price, and more.

# Methodology

*Data Preprocessing:* I performed extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing variables to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

*Feature Engineering:* I extracted relevant information from the dataset by creating new variables based on car mileage, age, and popularity of car brands.

*Machine Learning Models:* I explored various regression models, including linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to predict car prices based on the engineered features.

# Impact
This car price prediction model can provide valuable insights to both car buyers and sellers in the automotive market. It enables informed decision-making by estimating fair prices for listed cars and assisting buyers in finding the best deals.
